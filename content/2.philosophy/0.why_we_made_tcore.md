# Why we made TCore?

The goal behind TCore was simple, to provide secure backend infrastructure to developers, and to give more control to the consumers on what runs on their device. TCore is similar to a SaaS platform, however it is hosted directly on the devices of end users. This leads to increased performance, while giving the end user the opportunity to be in control of their data.
