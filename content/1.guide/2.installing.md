Get the latest docker image for TCore from Docker hub:
[TCore docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/huski3/tli-bundle)

::code-group

```bash [latest]
docker pull huski3/tli-bundle:latest
```

```bash [stable]
docker pull huski3/tli-bundle:stable
```

```bash [git]
# get <commit> from git
docker pull huski3/tli-bundle:indev-<commit>

## Post install

**Testing the installation**

Now that we have TCore downloaded, lets get started by creating a new container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name tli -d huski3/tli-bundle:latest start
```

Here we create our container named tli

Running the above command will launch the sAPI. We can test if the container is running by going to [http://0.0.0.0:8080/](http://0.0.0.0:8080/)
