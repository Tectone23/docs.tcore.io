## Post install

**Testing the installation**

Now that we have TCore downloaded, lets get started by creating a new container

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 --name tli -d huski3/tli-bundle:latest start
```

Here we create our container named tli

Running the above command will launch the sAPI. We can test if the container is running by going to [http://0.0.0.0:8080/](http://0.0.0.0:8080/)
