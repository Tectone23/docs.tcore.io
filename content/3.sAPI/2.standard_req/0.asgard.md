# Cog index

In this section, we talk about the `/asgard` and `/list_asgard` endpoints

`/asgard` and `/list_asgard` both do essentially the same thing. However, `/list_asgard` is less verbose, and only provides the name of cogs as a

This endpoint exists to be able to check if a cog exists.

## Some example responses

Lets look at some examples of the response sent to us back. In these examples, we assume that the user has a cog installed called "test".

**/asgard**

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "test": {
      // This is a cog
      "name": "test",
      "source": {
        "test": "print('Hello from Python')\nreturn 2"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**/list_asgard**

```json
{
  "code": 200,
  "data": {
    "data": ["test"] // a list of all cogs
  }    
}
```
As you can see above, `/list_asgard` only provides the bare minimum information. Hence this endpoint is used to check if a cog exists.
