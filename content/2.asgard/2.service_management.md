# Service management
Just like any platform, Asgard has its own runtime with a multitude of services. These range from native calls to the JVM to accessing system specific components like GPS. The best way to communicate with a device but maintain simplicity is to use the built-in `System` class, it wraps every component needed to work with the system, more information regarding the JVM access can be found at [Java Bindings](https://docs-tcore-io-indev.vercel.app/asgard/java_bindings).

Currently a cog can not run its own service, instead it's recommended to have asynchronous calls to trigger a task.

Task scheduling will be bundled as a proper feature in the future versions.

In terms of Asgardâ€™s own services, these run in new instances of the python interpreter together with the runtime. These instances import the libraries required by the runtime as well as change the syntax using a preprocessor for the cog actions.
